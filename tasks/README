                               PS3MFW tasks v0.3 OtherOS++ / CFW 4.xx
==============================================================

Big major clean up and update of MFW Builder. I merged task's and added new ones like lv2,lv0,appldr and all other excluding lv1 patches are merged into the patch_cos.tcl. I leave the lv1 patches like they are in case of the amount of the patches. WE have the new auto generate MFW/CFW script which will (like the name indicate) auto genrate predefined MFW/CFW 's. This script have a lot of checks implemented to save the user for bricking his console. One of this checks is a SHA1 checksum test on the input PUP which will verifiy if the input PUP is a Official non corrupted one. Also you can not use any OFW PUP as input PUP anymore. The auto gen script is exactly predefined also for input FW's which mean's for Rogero MFW/CFW you only can use 4.30 OFW and for OtherOS++ only OFW 3.55 is allowed to time. A self defined MFW can use a few more FW's as input. If you are a more advanced user you can deactivate this check and use any PUP as input just like in previous versions.

Then i added some more custom XMB thing's like to modify the xmb system sound's, gameboot image and the coldboot message. Inspired by PSDev and to be more user frindly i removed the task's for to add the moded .wav file to the .rco to just and simply change the modded .rco. So if some one have a modded .rco ready he just need to share the file in a forum. End user's then simply put the file into the correct folder (eg. /systemRCO [for the system sound's]) within the templat folder and then just choose the rco from the option in MFW Builder to inject/replace the moded file. Coldboot message is not ready yet.

I added and changed such a lot of stuff that i would to be annoying you if i would note here everything i have done. The list below is long enough to read ^^

-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.15 update 'euss'
-------------------------------
- Merged downgrader patches (from old seperate patch_lv1checks.tcl) into patch_lv1.tcl
- Moved patch_appldr.tcl to tasks/unsafe
- Added add_356keys_to_appldr341.tcl to tasks/unsafe - this should at least make 3.56 content playable on 3.41
- Added add_360keys_to_appldr355.tcl to tasks/unsafe - this should at least make 3.56 content playable on 3.55 (3.60 still gives error "EAUTHFAIL | 0x80010017 | Program authentication fail (Error starting BluRay game)" which may need to be addressed outside appldr)
- Added change_coreos_files.tcl to make it easier to replace CoreOS files that have been externaly made (e.g. with HxD and Scetool to workaround self_rebuilder issue).
Note: self_rebuilder requires fix, as it now produces non encrypted appldr sections, which lockups the console with blackscreen (it can enter XMB in FSM or debricked with PSgrade/JIG or reflashing with basic downgrader patches from ps3devwiki.com)

Thanks: Anonymous Developers (Code Monkeys), glu0n and Rogero


-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.14 update 'euss'
-------------------------------
- Added 'glevand' Lv1 patches :
  --patch-lv1-gpu-4kb-iopage: Allow 4kb IO page size for GPU GART memory
  --patch-lv1-otheros-plus-plus-cold-boot-fix: OtherOS++ cold boot fix


-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.13 update 'euss'
-------------------------------
- Splitted DEX task for nasplugin.sprx - no need to port lv2 or lv1.


-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.12 update 'euss'
-------------------------------
- Updated Spoof task up to including 4.20
- Expanded firmware list up to including 4.20
- New task/proof of concept: Jailbait patches to spoof firmware build & version for SEN/PSN access - Collides/merges several other tasks (e.g. Spoof), so only enable either, not both.
- Updated patch_emer_init.tcl - more proper size selection with pulldown menu. 1/2, 1/4th, 1/8th, and several fixed sizes like 22GB and 10GB up to 1000GB in 10GB increments can be selected. Warning! only select valid sizes based on your harddrive model, as the task (and the PUP it makes) will NOT be able to check it.


-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.11 update 'euss'
-------------------------------

- Updated Spoof task up to including 4.11
- Expanded firmware list up to including 4.11
- New task made on request:
  - broken_bluetooth.tcl - Allows you to remove Bluetooth firmware installation so that the MFW can be installed without a working Bluetooth board (circumventing errorcode 0x8002F1F9). This is potentially dangerous if used on a PS3 with a working BT/Wifi board, and should only be used if the BT/Wifi is broken.

Translation Guide:
* The file is in XML UTF-8 format. Make sure you use an UTF-8 compatible editor (e.g. Notepad++)
* Name the file itself in normal characters only (format is "English name_localised name, e.g. French_Francais.xml and /not/ French_Français.xml !). 
* Provide a localised translation for each word/line within the XML subitems.
* Save and try it in PS3MFW Builder. In some cases (e.g. Korean) the characters do not appear in the editor, but /will/ apear inside MFW Builder because of the UTF-8 encoder.
